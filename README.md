# TO DO APP WITH REACT 

## About The Project
I am very excited to share this project with you because It's my first REACT project. I had a chance to use the useState and useEffect hooks that I have learnt so far. As I go along with this project I got the idea of algorithm behind inputs and how to manipulate and use input values with components. Also with useEffect I manage to manipulate localstorage. Whenever you enter new task to input area datas are stored to localStorage and whenever you refresh the pages task that you entered beforehand do not lost.. In short I have learnt a lot of from this project. I hope you like the project as well..

## ABOUT ME 
Hello Everyone. Let me briefly introduce myself to you. First of all I am so glad to see that you are looking at my project. I am 26 years old. I am a mechanical engineer. After my graduation I worked as an engineer in the field somewhere in the region of 5 months. However, after working a few month I felt like it was not for me and I was not happy. After That I decided to research on different careers specifically those that include web development, because I have always been interested in coding, software, computer and its components. After extensive research, I grew more interest towards coding and I felt driven and motivated to become a genuinely brilliant frontend web developer. I would like to add that my education background that engineering has taught me how to work in an higly orginised and systematic way which allows me to learn in an effective way. What I mean is my enginnering background has been making great contrubutions to my learning process. I hope I did not bore you with my brief introduction.
